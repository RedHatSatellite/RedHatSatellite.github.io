<p>This organization exists to provide a location to curate scripts/projects that Red Hat employees, customers, and community members have written for usage with Red Hat Satellite.  We would like to leverage this organization in the following manner</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a clearinghouse of well maintained tools known to work with a supported version of Satellite. </li>
<li>Allow users of Satellite to showcase their work and develop their brand. </li>
<li>Provide a process for content to eventually become part of the Foreman upstream (and eventually a proper part of the product). </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h3>

<p>Want to contribute? We don't ask for much. Mainly that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You actively maintain your code/projects and are responsive to issues/PRs</li>
	<li>You denote which version of Satellite your code/projects work against</li>
	<li>You provide documentation on the proper usage of your code/projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Still interested? Reach out to one of the maintainers below so that we can add your project. Our onboarding process works like such</p>

<h4>For repos not currently hosted on Github</h4>

<li>We'll invite you to join the RedHatSatellite org</li>
<li>Reach out to external contributors to inform them of the new location</li>

</ul>

Note: this process is based on the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account/">Standard Github Transfer process</a>, and will allow preservation of commit history, open issues, PRs, etc. 
<ul>
<li>Coordinate the repository transfer with one of the maintainers below. (You'll transfer the repo to them. Then they will transfer it into the Satellite org)</li>
